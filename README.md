Team 2442A's Core Library
------------------------

This library contains a collection of useful features to help with software development for Vex EDR robots using the RobotC language and development environment. Our team would like to thank, among many others, James Pearman for his starter ideas and concepts found throughout this project.

This code is provided open-source under the MIT license, and collaboration is encouraged. Development is (somewhat) still underway and our teams continue to use this library; hopefully through the years to come.
